# UT Spring 2023
This repository consists of major projects and assignments I completed at the University of Texas at Austin during my Spring 2023 semester. Each project presents knowledge of analytical practices as well as technical skills to provide information from data.

## Data Science for Economic Policy (FIN 372)
In this course, I learned state-of-the-art data science methods for solving problems in economics and policy. Topics included:
1) Causality
2) Probability
3) Prediction
4) Unsupervised Learning
5) Networks + Text

I was additionally able to improve my proficiency in **R for data analysis**, and my coding skills have improved significantly. The course has given me the confidence to tackle more complex projects and has opened up new opportunities for me in the field of data science.

## Predictive Analytics (BAX 357)
This class served as my introduction to machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, with a focus on business applications and decision-making. I examinded predictive frameworks including the following:
1) Tree-Based Techniques
2) Artificial Neural Networks
3) Model Evaluation
4) Algorithmic Decision-Making

Additionally, I became familiar with the **Python** machine learning tool, **scikit-learn**. I've learned a lot about how to use various algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering, and my ability to apply these techniques to real-world problems has improved significantly. The course has given me the means to tackle predictive problems while developing important technical skills.

## Data Management (BAX 327)
In this course, I learned how to tailor data strategy to business strategy and developed the technical skills necessary to understanding, acquiring, and storing data efficiently, and processing the data for analysis. Some skills that I learned include:
1) How to engineer and manage data pipelines
2) Create data stores for analytics
3) How to implement data governance

In addition to these skills, I became proficient in **SQL**. SQL has been a major asset to my data management skills in the past, and I enjoyed becoming familiar with the **Oracle SQL Server**. With a better understanding of SQL, I can now work with relational databases more effectively and efficiently. I can easily write complex queries, filter and aggregate data, and perform data transformations.
