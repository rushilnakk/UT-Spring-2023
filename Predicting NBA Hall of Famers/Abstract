Final project for Predictive Analytics (BAX 357)

In this project I used real data on past basketball players to develop a machine learning model to inform memorabilia investment decisions. The dataset includes 27 different predictors/attributes on each player, with the target variable indicating whether or not the player has been inducted into the Hall of Fame. The task was to build a classification model predicting whether or not a player will be inducted and to apply this model to select players to invest in. The goal is to develop a strategy that maximizes profitability while investing $4,000,000 in the memorabilia of up to 100 players. The revenue from selling the memorabilia of an inducted player is estimated to be $120,000, while a non-inducted player results in a loss of 50% of the initial investment.
