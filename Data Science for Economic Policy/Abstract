According to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, violent crimes in California can be defined as one of the following 5 categories: Assault, Burglary, Robbery, Domestic Violence, and Weapon Laws. Police dispatchers receive 240 million calls per year, amounting to 7.6 calls ever second. Since a majority of these calls have nothing to do with crime or violence, I thought it would be beneficial to be able to predict violent crimes to provide law enforcement with the means to make safer, data-supported decisions. I attempted to predict violent crimes using a variety of models that were trained and tested on the same data set. My data was collected from DataSF, which is a site containing hundreds of data sets from the city of San Francisco. By navigating to the ‘Public Safety’ tab, I was able to find a crime data set that seemed to contain the most predictive variables for violent crimes.
